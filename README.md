# Task-Planner
Junior Web Developer: Final Project 

Hi, this is my final project for JWD! The task is to create a task planner app from scratch.
This repository consists of working and completed files/versions of the final project! 
You will find a wireframe + stylesheet and HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.

The goal is to create a web app: "task planner" that is mobile first, responsive, and interactive.
